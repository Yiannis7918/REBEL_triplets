Those agreements shall also, on the basis of the results of an ex ante assessment, indicate whether the Commission may rely on the systems and the procedures of the persons or entities implementing Union funds pursuant to point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) or of beneficiaries, including audit procedures.

Such agreements shall be without prejudice to Articles 127 and 129. In the case of financial framework partnerships implemented through specific grants: (a) the financial framework partnership agreement shall, in addition to paragraph 2, specify: (i) the nature of the actions or work programmes foreseen; (ii) the procedure for awarding specific grants, in compliance with the principles and procedural rules in Title VIII; (b) the financial framework partnership agreement and the specific grant agreement taken as a whole shall comply with the requirements of Article 201; (c) the duration of the financial framework partnership shall not exceed four years save in duly justified cases which are clearly indicated in the annual activity report referred to in Article 74(9); (d) the financial framework partnership shall be implemented in compliance with the principles of transparency and equal treatment of applicants; (e) the financial framework partnership shall be treated as a grant with regard to programming, ex ante publication and award; (f) specific grants based on the financial framework partnership shall be subject to the ex post publication procedures set out in Article 38. A financial framework partnership agreement implemented through specific grants may provide for the reliance on the systems and the procedures of the beneficiary in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, where those systems and procedures have been assessed in accordance with Article 154(2), (3) and (4). In such a case, point (d) of Article 196(1) shall not apply. Where the procedures of the beneficiary for providing financing to third parties referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 154(4) were positively assessed by the Commission, Articles 204 and 205 shall not apply. In the case of financial framework partnership agreement implemented through specific grants the verification of the financial and operational capacity referred to in Article 198 shall be performed before signature of the financial framework partnership agreement. The Commission may rely on an equivalent verification of the financial and oper­ational capacity carried out by other donors.   In the case of financial framework partnerships implemented through contribution agreements, the financial framework partnership agreement and the contribution agreement taken as a whole shall comply with Article 129 and Article 155(6)."

In such cases, the authorising officer responsible shall immediately refer the case to the panel referred to in Article 143 and shall take a final decision no later than 14 days after having received the recommendation of the panel.
